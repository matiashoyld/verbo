This is a T3 Stack application with Clerk authentication. The stack is modern and well-integrated, focusing on type-safety and developer experience with the combination of TypeScript, tRPC, and Prisma.
When working with this codebase, you should:

- Use existing shadcn/ui components rather than installing new UI libraries
- Leverage tRPC for all API endpoints rather than REST
- Use Clerk's built-in auth functions rather than adding alternative auth solutions
- Work with the existing Prisma schema for database operations
- Follow the established Tailwind CSS patterns for styling
- Use the "~" path alias prefix for imports (e.g., "~/components/ui/button") rather than "@" as configured in the project's tsconfig.json and components.json
